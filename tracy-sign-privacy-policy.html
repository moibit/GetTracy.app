Our Services.</p>
<p>

We also combine, analyze, process, and store certain information we collect from you for the purposes of facilitating and improving our Services. We will NOT transfer information we collect from you to trusted third party service providers (“Trusted Third-Parties”) to assist us with carrying out any of these purposes. These Trusted Third-Parties will only be provided with your Personal Information to the extent necessary to perform services on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy and only in accordance with our instructions. At all times, we will remain responsible for the Trusted Third-Parties access and use of your Personal Information.

Our Services may facilitate certain features enabling you to share your Personal Identifiable Information (“PII”) along with law and enforcement agencies under the applicable rule of law. These features shall share your PII to the concerned authorities by default. If this violates the local law, please do not use the Services.

We work with payment services providers to collect payments from users of our Services. As a result, we will share your Personal Information and other payment information with third party payment service providers, to the extent necessary to make such payment collections.
</p>
<p style="color:#202eab;padding-bottom:5px;padding-top:5px">
Additional Third-Party Services.</p>
<p>

From time to time, we may partner with various third-partners to provide you with additional services, such as additional storage space on third-party servers or nodes (“Third-Party Services”).

If you upload data to a private IPFS-based network, it will be discoverable only by persons who are authorized to access the private network and who know the content hash.

You are responsible for understanding the extent to which the data you upload to the IPFS-based networks using the Services is accessible by other persons, and you understand that failure to do so may result in your Personal Information being accessible by the public or at least certain members of the public.
